Dear friends,

I stole the idea for this list from <a href="https://austinkleon.com" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">Austin Kleon</a>, who said that he stole it from another guy. The idea is quite intriguing, since it reminded me of a poem called <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uEUXvwuX_DyqFS0K4MeykW40VGQCGa8Rt1T5RlA-rHY/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">“London Rain”</a> by Louis MacNeice: “My wishes turn to violent, horses black as coal–; The Randy mares of fancy, the stallions of the soul; Eager to take the fences, That fence about my soul.” The list is supposed to tell you something about yourself, perhaps something moreso than your actual reading list.

<p>Essentially, I see this list as a sort of peek-over-the-fence; what I could be reading if I didn't have work to do! Anyway, here’s my take on it:</p>

<img src="/assets/images/10-books-1.png" style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top:1em;">

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">1. <b>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9673436-the-invention-of-hugo-cabret" style="color:tomato" target="_blank"><b>Brian Selznick</b></a></p>
<p style="font-size:1.0em">All I know about this book is that it’s about a boy who lives in a train station clock tower, and that it was made into a film. It won the 2008 <a href="https://abqlibrary.org/caldecott/all" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">Caldecott Medal</a>, though, which is awarded to the “artist for the most distinguished American picture book for children”. Looks great.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">2. <b>Van Gogh Still Lifes</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52576063-van-gogh" style="color:tomato" target="_blank"><b>Obtrude Westheider</b></a></p>
“A great fire burns within me, but no one stops to warm themselves at it, and passers-by only see a wisp of smoke”. It's hard to say whether Van Gogh intended a solipstic reading of that quote, but it just goes to show that, really, all the great artists have been great <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51921466-through-vincent-s-eyes" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">intellectuals</a>. And in the summer, I hope to go to New York, to finally see his <a href="https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/art-and-stories/stories/all-stories/where-is-the-starry-night" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">greatest painting</a>!

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">3. <b>First Love</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3532.First_Love?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_19" style="color:tomato" target="_blank"><b>Ivan Turgenev</b></a></p>
The author Avrahm Yarmolinsky apparently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/theater/about-love-review-culture-project.html" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">said</a> of Turgenev's book that "the page was warmed by the glow of a casual affair”. Henry James, who loved Turgenev, believed that Turgenev is more worth reading than Tolstoy and Dostoyevksy (once I read War and Peace and The Brothers Karamazov, I guess I’ll make up my own mind). The book is supposedly about unrequited love, which sucks! But, since I loved Turgenev’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19117.Fathers_and_Sons" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">Fathers and Sons</a>, I’m looking forward to giving it a go.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">4. <b>Dream Story</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157409.Dream_Story" style="color:tomato" target="_blank"><b>Arthur Schnitzler</b></a></p>
This story is the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut, a film I love a lot. If you haven't seen it, I recommend it. Then afterwards read this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902030345/http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/2003/Greenwich%20conference.html" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">analysis</a>.

<img src="/assets/images/10-books-2.png" style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top:1em;">

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">5. <b>The Narrow Road to the Deep North</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20168578-the-narrow-road-to-the-deep-north-and-other-travel-sketches" style="color:tomato" target="_blank"><b>Matsuo Basho</b></a></p>
Who doesn’t love a good Basho poem? "An ancient pond / a frog jumps in / the splash of water”. There’s nothing else to say; nature speaks for itself (or doesn't, given the stillness Basho tries to capture in <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/221867/moon-woke-me-up-nine-times-by-matsuo-basho-translated-by-david-young/" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">The Moon Woke Me Up Nine Times</a>).

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">6. <b>Night of the Milky Way Railway</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/416527.Night_of_the_Milky_Way_Railway" style="color:tomato" target="_blank"><b>Kenji Miyazawa</b></a></p>
I’m kinda drawn to this book like a Raven to shiny things (which, for, some reason, reminded me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_paradox" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">Raven paradox</a>). Anyway, this book has such a great cover. I can’t wait to buy a copy and read it!

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">7. <b>A Beautiful Question: Finding Nature’s Deep Design</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23453106-a-beautiful-question" style="color:tomato" target="_blank"><b>Frank Wilczek</b></a></p>
By accident one day, I discovered this giant of <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2004/wilczek/facts/" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">physics</a>! I have his other books, The Lightness of Being and Fundamentals: Ten Keys to Reality, but this one has eluded me. The idea of beauty inherent in the physical construction of the universe, and how it could be used for new discoveries, sounds fascinating. Perhaps 2025 will be the year when I get round to this gem.

<img src="/assets/images/10-books-3.png" style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top:1em;">

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">8. <b>The Wind in the Willows</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5659.The_Wind_in_the_Willows" style="color:tomato" target="_blank"><b>Kenneth Grahame</b></a></p>
I love children’s books, and the fact that I haven’t read as many as I’d like this year is a shame (although I did read Hayao Miyazaki’s only published work, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60384799-shuna-s-journey" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">Shuna's Journey</a>, which is fantastic and I highly recommend it). Maybe I’ll get round to this when I also get round to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348573.The_Borrowers" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">The Borrowers</a> by Mary Norton.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">9. <b>Substance, Force, and the Possibility of Knowledge: On Kant’s Philosophy of the Material World</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9053800-substance-force-and-the-possibility-of-knowledge?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_51" style="color:tomato" target="_blank"><b>Jeffrey Edwards</b></a></p>
<p>Months after starting Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, I'm still slogging through it. What’s so surprising about Kant, contrary to popular opinion, is how clear he actually is as a writer; after every sentence, I stop to jot down notes. And then I spend a week thinking about it. His works are an amazing tapestry; and his <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/312762.Opus_Postumum" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">Opus Postumum</a> is one I'm really looking forward to, especially to see if he makes good on his claim of deriving natural science from his philosophy of nature.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">10. <b>Lectures on Imagination</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126228052-lectures-on-imagination?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=Wjf4U5gKh2&rank=1" style="color:tomato" target="_blank"><b>Paul Ricoeur</b></a></p>
<p>I don’t really know anything about Ricoeur, besides the fact that he wrote a book about <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/257134.Freud_and_Philosophy" style="color:tomato" target="_blank">Freud, Nietzsche and Marx</a>. But a book about the mind’s powers sounds right up my alley.</p>

<p>At the end of the month, I’ll also post my top 10 books of 2024. So watch this space!</p>
