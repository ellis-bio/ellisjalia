<p style="font-size:1.7em; margin-bottom:0"><strong>My top 10 albums of 2024</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:0.9em;">Tuesday, December 24, 2024</p>
<img src="/assets/images/albums.png" style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top:1em;"><br>

<p>When I first heard Pink Floyd’s “Money” on a Vinyl recording this year, it was like I’d heard music for the first time. The electric guitar seeped into my bones. And like a lot of people, I’ve been drawn to vinyl records for the depth and warmth of the sound they produce.</p>

<p>It’s only this year that I’ve come to appreciate that vinyl is an instance of an old technology that has stuck around for a reason: because it’s that good. There are some albums that of course, given some good speakers, are really, really good no matter which format you listen to them through.</p>

<p>So here’s ten albums that I’ve loved this year:</p>

<img src="/assets/images/albums-1.png" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top:1.5em;">

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">1. <b>The New Four Seasons</b>, Max Richter</p>
To title your album “The New Four Seasons” is big and presumptous; but Max Richter lives up to Vivaldi’s original. This album has incredible depth to it and is such a joy to listen to it over and over again.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">2. <b>Beethoven Symphonies Nos. 5 & 7</b>, Carlos Kleiber</p>
Again, whoever conducts Beethoven has big shoes to fill. But dare I say that these renditions of the 5th and 7th symphonies are the best there have ever been?

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">3. <b>The Dark Side of the Moon</b>, Pink Floyd</p>
What’s there to say about this album? The 2003 Vinyl LP sounds out of this world; especially “The Great Gig in the Sky”, which filled my soul with its soaring vocals, and “Us and Them”, which, while I have no idea what they’re singing about, sounds incredible.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">4. <b>The 50 Greatest Hits</b>, Elvis Presley</p>
Every other month, I listen to a new Elvis album, and I discover some great hit. From this album, and amongst his greatest, I’ve discovered “Lawdy, Miss Clawdy” and “(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear”.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">5. <b>The Doors</b>, The Doors</p>
I can’t tell you how often I play this album. It’s definitely one of my favourites, with classic tracks like “Break on Through (To The Other Side)”, “Soul Kitchen”, and “Back Door Man”.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">6. <b>Smiley Smile</b>, The Beach Boys</p>
“Good Vibrations” is one hell of a song; how does someone even sing like that? This is just a great feel-good album overall, with great songs like “Heroes and Villains” and “Gettin’ Hungry”.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">7. <b>Why Do Fools Fall in Love</b>, Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers</p>
The band’s vocalist, Frankie Lymon, died at the age 25 from a heroin overdose. The music industry missed out as a result of his unfortunate early death; what an astonishing voice he had.

<img src="/assets/images/albums-3.png" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top:1.5em;">

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">8. <b>Con Todo El Mundo</b>, Khruangbin</p>
There's something about this album. It conveys some feeling, perhaps something which captures the title ‘Con Todo El Mundo’, which means “With Everybody”. It’s beautiful.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">9. <b>The New Standard</b>, Jamie Saft</p>
This and the above album are the ones I’ve discovered most recently; and funnily enough when they’re listened to back to back they kinda work together. But this is classic jazz, while the above is Texan soul-dub psychedelia.

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">10. <b>Kel Tamasheq</b>, Terakaft</p>
Did someone say Libyan desert psychedelic rock? I don’t know what Terakaft sing about, maybe about desert mirages and how hot it’s out there––who knows, because I don’t want to know––but their song “Awa Adounia” fills space like few other songs.
