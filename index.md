<center><img src="/assets/images/moments.jpeg" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;"></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Before atoms were empirically verified, the philosopher <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Leibnizs-Monadology-New-Translation-Guide/dp/074869322X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=355OSBV9QMY12&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.P74slB61DL_NxxCJjOYyV1Z8---gFQEmsfcdtpa92EkWkVtN0XwDBVFyq0ypJ9Ro0vnYCUiMB-bWRLeb64hNsI60kTVlNGye_-ZDiASLCmoyoI_PacK5nUJIbWsCEcU4Zy0SeO2iA_DDeb_hj0f4CV-oPh__IaTPF-EWIC183gWnoiJhXVvysE56aszObNFPnaVz0FMugP2ICCTYo75stxMvmdzF_AKA15cGTykEPy4.pQRWl4J13A03ULgjMSCqNoNPx1o_5Se-n7u9HrXkmEI&dib_tag=se&keywords=leibniz+monadology&qid=1738189077&sprefix=leibniz+monadology%2Caps%2C108&sr=8-1" style="color:tomato">Leibniz</a> postulated that the universe is composed of an infinite number of ‘monads’, indivisible entities which only possess qualities. He wrote:
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">“4. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and, in a word, the
elements of things.”</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">“19. If we are to give the name of Soul to everything which has perceptions and desires [appetits] in the general sense which I have explained, then all simple substances or created Monads might be called souls…”</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">In a famous passage, he said that “monads have no windows”. Through the above sketches, I wanted to capture this idea; that the mind only sees what is internal to it––its perceptions and the changes that occur within them.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">But there is also another idea that I wanted to capture.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">In <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/World-Will-Representation-Vol-v/dp/0486217612" style="color:tomato">The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 1</a>, Schopenhauer has a quote about ‘Now’ (the quote is in a footnote, on page 280):
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">“The scholastics taught that eternity is not a succession without beginning and end, but a permanent Now; in other words, that we possess the same Now which existed for Adam; that is to say, there is no difference between the Now and the Then.”</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">There is also a reminiscence of an <a href="https://putsomethingback.stevejobsarchive.com/" style="color:tomato">e-mail</a> that Steve Jobs sent to himself, reminding him of his love, admiration and his total dependence on humanity for his survival and well-being. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">I wanted to capture these moments from my day, in addition to conveying those two ideas above, to remind me of the wonderful things that I am lucky to use and be able to do. </p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">These are things which I did not create nor understand (the computer, the sky and the trees), and those things which I need to stay alive.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">The wonder that is my iPhone.<br>
The strangeness and wonder of trees and the sky.<br>
My computer.<br>
Writing and sketching.<br>
Going for bike rides.<br>
Reading a book.<br>
Eating good food.<br>
Exercising.<br>
Sleeping.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">As time seems to run faster and faster, I recognise that life is but a collection of these moments.
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Just maybe, that’s what our brains are for: to lift a snapshot of reality, and to hold it in place for long enough so that we can point to it and say “Now”. </p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">And I also love drawing (when it goes right). It makes me feel really involved in my greatest passion, the joy of seeing.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">“I think I need to keep being creative, not to prove anything but because it makes me happy just to do it... I think trying to be creative, keeping busy, has a lot to do with keeping you alive.” - Willie Nelson</p>

<p style="font-size:0.95em; color: silver">Sunday, January 19, 2025</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">I’m supposed to be working on an essay about the philosophy of perception, but I’ve been really unwell and research has been difficult. So, instead, I've turned my attention to redesigning my living room and workspace.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/home-2.jpeg" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;"></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">For Christmas, I got a record player which has been sitting on the floor, and I wanted to try out some placements for it. Space is scarce, and in the doodle above, I’m committing the grave sin of putting the speakers on the same surface as the turntable. But I’m not after the pure audiophile experience so it’ll have to do for now.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">For the longest time, I’ve worked on this nice antique desk, with my MacBook Pro hooked up to a Thunderbolt Display, and an anglepoise lamp to the side.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/home-1.jpeg" style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top: 1em;"></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">The antique desk usually serves me well. But as I’ve placed an order for a new computer (an M4 Mac mini and Apple Studio Display with the height-adjustable stand), I thought this would be a good opportunity for an overhaul.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Sketching has given me insight into what works and what doesn’t; particularly with respect to the idea that each desirable activity ought to have a place of its own.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/home-3.jpeg" style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top: 1em;"></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">The new desk is made from oak, and it’s almost twice as large as my previous one. There would be enough space for a ceramic lamp, and potentially for two anglepoise lamps so the light is evenly distributed throughout.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">I’ve tried to seek inspiration from a variety of sources. Some of the colours have come from <a href="https://ukiyo-e.org/" style="color:tomato">ukiyo-e prints</a> made by Hokusai, Yoshitoshi and Kuniyoshi. Whereas material choice was mainly based on a concoction of old photos that I have from Obama’s terms in the White House, and other random pieces.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Ultimately what I’ve tried to create is a place that comes from deep within me, that combines beauty and care, and where I can test what I’m really capable of.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.7em; margin-bottom:0"><a href="https://ellisjalia.com/2025/01/10/reading-paths/"><b>Reading Paths</b></a></p>
<p style="font-size:0.95em; color: silver">Friday, January 10, 2025</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">For the past few months, I’ve been reading three books: Musashi by Eiji Yoshikawa; Monet: The Restless Vision by Jackie Wullschläger; and Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Little did I know the first two are basically whole lives. Monet is what I’ve been reading a lot of lately. It’s been such an immersive experience, from reading about him begging his friends to send him wine, to the tragic death of his wife, and the circumstances around the painting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magpie_(Monet)" style="color:tomato">“The Magpie”</a>.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/reading-paths-1.png" style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top: 1em;"></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Likewise with Musashi. Following him as he grows up, and as he learns that mastery of the sword comes through mastery of unrelated disciplines like calligraphy, pottery and painting, has opened up so many avenues. The Kant book is a different beast altogether, however, but I’m committed now. Even if it takes me a year, I will finish it.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">A question I’ve been posing myself recently is, <b>what reading paths should I take in the future?</b></p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/reading-paths-2.png" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;"></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">This quote by Jean Piaget got me thinking about reading as a path that you can take to increase your powers to order the world:

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">"The goal of education is not to increase the amount of knowledge but to create the possibilities for a child to invent and discover, to create men who are capable of doing new things."</p>
