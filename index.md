<p>One thing I’m interested in is finding new ways to combine my reading. In my previous post, I talked about reading paths. This is the idea that through reading, one can reason about things not by asking, “what happened?”, but “how could things be put together in new ways?”.</p>

<p>It’s also a Platonic view: that the reading paths are a way of becoming, or making yourself over time, as a conditional on the path you choose to take.</p>

<p>Although this view sounds interesting, at least philosophically, I’m generally more inclined to the view that the paths will reveal aspects of yourself that were hidden from view.</p>

<p>To expand on the idea of readings paths, I have in mind invention. The word ‘invention’ comes from ‘invencioun’, meaning “finding or discovering of something”. It also stems from the Latin ‘inventionem’, which means to “to come upon, find out”; and the Proto-Indo-European roots of ’in’ and ‘*gwa-’, meaning “to come” and “to go”.</p>

<p>What stands out to me is that to invent, you must go to the idea. That is, you must find out. To visualise this, I came up with the following method.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/invention.png" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;"></center>

<p>Art informs invention, and invention informs science, in the sense that often we go to the science we require to do what we have in mind; science will inform philosophy, and the chain is refreshed by literature.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">My favourite ancient myth is the trio of Atlas (meaning ‘uphold’), and his brothers Epimetheus (‘afterthought’) and Prometheus (‘forethought’). The latter two are supposed to represent the duality of mankind. </p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Following the mythological battle between the Titans and the Olympians, Atlas was condemned to uphold the sky for eternity. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Whereas Epimetheus was tasked with dividing the divine powers amongst the animals, but he forgot about mankind, who were left without a ‘telos’ or ultimate object or aim. Prometheus then had the forethought to steal the fire from the gods to give to humans, endowing us with knowledge, technology and civilisation.

<p style="font-size:0.95rem; color: silver">Friday, January 10, 2025</p>

<p>For the past few months, I’ve been reading three books: Musashi by Eiji Yoshikawa; Monet: The Restless Vision by Jackie Wullschläger; and Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant.</p>

<p>Little did I know the first two are basically whole lives. Monet is what I’ve been reading a lot of lately. It’s been such an immersive experience, from reading about him begging his friends to send him wine, to the tragic death of his wife, and the circumstances around the painting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magpie_(Monet)" style="color:tomato">“The Magpie”</a>.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/reading-paths-1.png" style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top: 1em;"></center>

<p>Likewise with Musashi. Following him as he grows up, and as he learns that mastery of the sword comes through mastery of unrelated disciplines like calligraphy, pottery and painting, has opened up so many avenues. The Kant book is a different beast altogether, however, but I’m committed now. Even if it takes me a year, I will finish it.</p>

<p>A question I’ve been posing myself recently is, <b>what reading paths should I take in the future?</b></p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/reading-paths-2.png" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;"></center>

<p>This quote by Jean Piaget got me thinking about reading as a path that you can take to increase your powers to order the world:

<p style="margin: 1.5em;">"The goal of education is not to increase the amount of knowledge but to create the possibilities for a child to invent and discover, to create men who are capable of doing new things."</p>
