<p style="font-size:1.1em;">In the <a href ="http://archive.eclass.uth.gr/eclass/modules/document/file.php/MHXD102/Vasari%20Giorgio_The_Lives_of_the_Artists_Oxford.pdf" style="color:tomato">Lives of the Artists</a>, the Italian biographer Giorgio Vasari writes that, in the last moments of his life, Leonardo da Vinci rebuked himself for having “offended God and mankind in not having worked at his art as he should have”. Da Vinci's biggest influence in his own time was his contribution to painting, while his notebooks remained unpublished, leaving it to the modern world to come to terms with his genius.

<p style="font-size:1.1em; ">Da Vinci was born in 1452 and died in 1519, at the age of 67. Throughout his life, he worked on many projects, many of which he left unfinished; it is a conflict that Sigmund Freud <a href ="http://archive.eclass.uth.gr/eclass/modules/document/file.php/MHXD102/Vasari%20Giorgio_The_Lives_of_the_Artists_Oxford.pdf" style="color:tomato">describes</a> as the natural scientist encroaching on, suppressing, and finally overrunning the artist within. Even during his own life, his skill earned him a great reputation, which only grew after his death, culminating in our understanding and appreciation of him as the archetypal Renaissance figure. Vasari writes:</p>

><p style="font-size:1.05em; "“...Nature so favoured him that, wherever he turned his thought, his mind, and his heart, he demonstrated with such divine inspiration that no one else was ever equal to him in the perfection, liveliness, vitality, excellence, and grace of his works.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.1em; ">Da Vinci was known as a pleasant man, both in conversation, and in his love for animals. He is said to have purchased birds held in cages in order to set them free, and “give them the liberty they had lost”. With every action, he enhanced every miserly and modest living place, and was widely loved for his stature and the beauty of his work. The city of Florence, Vasari says, received the greatest gift with Da Vinci's birth, and the greatest loss when he died.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.1em; ">Here is a man then, who with so much elegance, finesse and neatness, is able to enquire with unparalleled genius into the unity of nature and its myriad of astonishing patterns. What is it that made Da Vinci's mind special? To answer this question, it's essential to examine his contributions to art, anatomy and scientific drawing, neuroscience, innovation, and ultimately, the blueprint of the scientific mind.</p>

<h3>Leonardo as Artist</h3>

<p style="font-size:1.1em; ">Da Vinci revered the sense of vision, and placed it as man's highest sense. </p>

<blockquote><p style="font-size:1.1em;"><strong>“</strong> The were was infused in this genius so much divine grace, so formidable and harmonious a combination of intellect and memory to serve it, as well as so great an ability to express his ideas through the designs of his hands, that he won over with arguments and confounded the with reasonings the boldest minds. <strong></strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p style="font-size:1.05em; ">Leonardo was so pleasing in conversation that he won everyone's hearts. And although we might say that he owned nothing and worked very little, he always kept servants and horses; he took special pleasure in horses as he did in all other animals, which he treated with the greatest love and patience. For example, when passing by places where birds were being sold, he would often take them out of their cages with his own hands, and after paying the seller the price that was asked of him, he would set them free in the air, restoring to them the liberty they had lost. As a result, Nature so favoured him that, wherever he turned his thought, his mind, and his heart, he demonstrated with such divine inspiration that no one else was ever equal to him in the perfection, liveliness, vitality, excellence, and grace of his works.</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote><p style="font-size:1.05em; ">It is clearly evident that because of Leonardo's understanding of art, he began many projects but never finished any of them, feeling that his hand could not reach artistic perfection in the works he conceived, since he envisioned such subtle, marvellous, and difficult problems that his hands, while extremely skilful, were incapable of ever realizing them. And his special interests...</p></blockquote>

><p style="font-size:1.05em; ">...the greatest geniuses sometimes accomplish more when they work less, since they are searching for inventions in their minds, and forming those perfect ideas which their hands then express and reproduce from what they previously conceived with their intellect.</p>

><p style=" font-size: 1.05em; ">The eyes have the lustre and moisture always seen in living people, while around them are the lashes and all the reddish tones which cannot be produced without the greatest care. The eyebrows could not be more natural, for they represent the way the hair grows in the skin—thicker in some places and thinner in others, following the pores of the skin. The nose seems lifelike with its beautiful pink and tender nostrils. The mouth, with its opening joining the red of the lips to the flesh of the face, seemed to be real flesh rather than paint. Anyone who looked very attentively at the hollow of her throat would see her pulse beating: to tell the truth, it can be said that portrait was painted in a way that would cause every brave artist to tremble and fear, whoever he might be.</p>

<h3>Anatomy & Scientific Drawing</h3>

<blockquote><p style="font-size:1.05em; ">“He drew all the bony structures, joining them in order to all the nerves and covering them with the muscles: the first group is attached to the skeleton, the second it holds firm, and the third makes it move, and in these drawings he wrote notes in various places in ugly characters written with the left hand from right to left, which cannot be understood by anyone who is not used to reading them, since they cannot be read without a mirror..”</p></blockquote>

<h3>Contributions to Neuroscience</h3>

<h3>Innovation</h3>

<h3>The Scientific Mind</h3>

Perhaps the closest we'll ever get to understanding the natural world and the multiplicity of objects in it, is to ask ourselves, "how does it behave––what is it doing now?"".

with great care studies and honours the natural world
