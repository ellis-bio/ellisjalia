<p style="margin-top: 2em;">"One, two, three, — but where, my dear Timaeus, is the fourth...?" - Plato</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve experimented with active imagination, a technique made famous by the psychiatrist Carl Jung. The aim of the method is to draw up images from the unconscious, as a means of providing the self with information about its state and condition, and as a means of arriving to the true nature of the self.</p>

<p>It begins with actively imagining a state of affairs, or closing your eyes and drawing images, and the idea is that naturally a bridge will be built between the “empirical self” - what one actively perceives and thinks - and the total self, which includes the contents of the unconscious.</p>

<p>While I didn't know what to expect, it has been an enlightening experience. A few years ago, I actively sought the dissolution of the ego (and that of the persona), so that I might separate myself from the suggestions of the collective unconscious. Being ill prepared for this task, and resolutely naive in my underestimation of the power that archetypal images exert over the psyche, I plunged into darkness. For many years, I did not know up from down, or left from right.</p>

<p>Even to this day, the unconscious exerts such significant control over my mental life, that I am taken under at a moments notice, into the shadow lands. Not only does this have the unfortunate side effect of completely alienating me from society, my family, and my friends, but I constantly feel the pull of the unconscious, exerting its formidable influence over my behaviours. As a result, there is in me a representation of the archetypal “Wanderer” - a man broken by the winds of time, whose memories have been washed away, and he can no longer return home nor remember what he seeks.</p>

<p>But all is not lost. For you see, in my battle with myself, this inner civil war, I have grown to understand the unconscious, what it might represent, and how to use its strengths. I have begun to engage it in serious diplomacy.</p>

<p>I speak of the unconscious as an “it” - for anyone who has disassociated from the collective psyche are well aware that the unconscious is alive. It is a dynamic entity of an autonomous nature, living behind the veil of experience, that possesses its own desires and wishes. For the world truly exists with two great forces within it - good and evil. This is not to say that the unconscious is inherently evil, because I do not think that is the case, but I believe it possesses the capacity for evil. Like Jung said, “man is the great danger”.</p> 

<p>What I have said so far is neither original nor out of the extraordinary - because this knowledge goes back one hundred years to the great founding psychologists, and to the Ancient Greeks before that. So what, then, is the point that I’m making? It’s simply this: the unconscious can be as powerful in guiding you towards the right path as any information received externally.</p>

<p>But let me urge that you take great caution - the unconscious is truly a heavy burden to carry, and it has broken me more times than I care to admit. It is fortunate that I have discovered ways of stitching the psyche back together again. So take great care should you go diving into that vast lake where monsters, gods, and kings - the archetypes - pull the strings behind Man’s emotions and behaviours. Journey into yourself, if you haven’t already done so. For I assure you my friend, reader, the treasure that you seek is within you.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.95rem; color: silver">Tuesday, March 4, 2025</p>

<p>One thing I’m interested in is finding new ways to combine my reading. In one of my previous posts, I talked about reading paths. This is the idea that through reading, one can reason about things not by asking, “what happened?”, but “how could things be put together in new ways?”.</p>

<p>It’s also a Platonic view: that the reading paths are a way of becoming, or making yourself over time, as a conditional on the path you choose to take.</p>

<p>Although this view sounds interesting, at least philosophically, I’m generally more inclined to the view that the paths will reveal aspects of yourself that were hidden from view.</p>

<p>To expand on the idea of readings paths, I have in mind invention. The word ‘invention’ comes from ‘invencioun’, meaning “finding or discovering of something”. It also stems from the Latin ‘inventionem’, which means to “to come upon, find out”; and the Proto-Indo-European roots of ’in’ and ‘*gwa-’, meaning “to come” and “to go”.</p>

<p>What stands out to me is that to invent, you must go to the idea. That is, you must find out. To visualise this, I came up with the following method.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/invention.png" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;"></center>

<p>Art informs invention, and invention informs science, in the sense that often we go to the science we require to do what we have in mind; science will inform philosophy, and the chain is refreshed by literature.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.95em; color: silver">Friday, January 24, 2025</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/atlas-1.png" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;"></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">My favourite ancient myth is the trio of Atlas (meaning ‘uphold’), and his brothers Epimetheus (‘afterthought’) and Prometheus (‘forethought’). The latter two are supposed to represent the duality of mankind. </p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Following the mythological battle between the Titans and the Olympians, Atlas was condemned to uphold the celestial spheres for eternity. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Whereas Epimetheus was tasked with dividing the divine powers amongst the animals, but he forgot about mankind, who were left without a ‘telos’ or ultimate object or aim. Prometheus then had the forethought to steal the fire from the gods to give to humans, endowing us with knowledge, technology and civilisation.

<p style="font-size:0.95rem; color: silver">Friday, January 10, 2025</p>

<p>For the past few months, I’ve been reading three books: Musashi by Eiji Yoshikawa; Monet: The Restless Vision by Jackie Wullschläger; and Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant.</p>

<p>Little did I know the first two are basically whole lives. Monet is what I’ve been reading a lot of lately. It’s been such an immersive experience, from reading about him begging his friends to send him wine, to the tragic death of his wife, and the circumstances around the painting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magpie_(Monet)" style="color:tomato">“The Magpie”</a>.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/reading-paths-1.png" style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top: 1em;"></center>

<p>Likewise with Musashi. Following him as he grows up, and as he learns that mastery of the sword comes through mastery of unrelated disciplines like calligraphy, pottery and painting, has opened up so many avenues. The Kant book is a different beast altogether, however, but I’m committed now. Even if it takes me a year, I will finish it.</p>

<p>A question I’ve been posing myself recently is, <b>what reading paths should I take in the future?</b></p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/reading-paths-2.png" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;"></center>

<p>This quote by Jean Piaget got me thinking about reading as a path that you can take to increase your powers to order the world:

<p style="margin: 1.5em;">"The goal of education is not to increase the amount of knowledge but to create the possibilities for a child to invent and discover, to create men who are capable of doing new things."</p>
