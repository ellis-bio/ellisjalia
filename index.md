<p style="font-size:1.10em;">My favourite ancient myth is the trio of Atlas (meaning ‘uphold’), and his brothers Epimetheus (‘afterthought’) and Prometheus (‘forethought’). The latter two are supposed to represent the duality of mankind. </p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Following the mythological battle between the Titans and the Olympians, Atlas was condemned to uphold the celestial spheres for eternity. </p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Epimetheus was tasked with dividing the divine powers amongst the animals, but he forgot about mankind, who were left without a ‘telos’ or ultimate object or aim. Prometheus then had the forethought to steal the fire from the gods to give to humans, endowing us with knowledge, technology and civilisation.

<p style="font-size:0.95em; color: silver">Sunday, January 19, 2025</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">I’m supposed to be working on an essay about the philosophy of perception, but I’ve been really unwell and research has been difficult. So, instead, I've turned my attention to redesigning my living room and workspace.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/home-2.jpeg" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;"></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">For Christmas, I got a record player which has been sitting on the floor, and I wanted to try out some placements for it. Space is scarce, and in the doodle above, I’m committing the grave sin of putting the speakers on the same surface as the turntable. But I’m not after the pure audiophile experience so it’ll have to do for now.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">For the longest time, I’ve worked on this nice antique desk, with my MacBook Pro hooked up to a Thunderbolt Display, and an anglepoise lamp to the side.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/home-1.jpeg" style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top: 1em;"></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">The antique desk usually serves me well. But as I’ve placed an order for a new computer (an M4 Mac mini and Apple Studio Display with the height-adjustable stand), I thought this would be a good opportunity for an overhaul.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Sketching has given me insight into what works and what doesn’t; particularly with respect to the idea that each desirable activity ought to have a place of its own.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/home-3.jpeg" style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top: 1em;"></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">The new desk is made from oak, and it’s almost twice as large as my previous one. There would be enough space for a ceramic lamp, and potentially for two anglepoise lamps so the light is evenly distributed throughout.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">I’ve tried to seek inspiration from a variety of sources. Some of the colours have come from <a href="https://ukiyo-e.org/" style="color:tomato">ukiyo-e prints</a> made by Hokusai, Yoshitoshi and Kuniyoshi. Whereas material choice was mainly based on a concoction of old photos that I have from Obama’s terms in the White House, and other random pieces.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Ultimately what I’ve tried to create is a place that comes from deep within me, that combines beauty and care, and where I can test what I’m really capable of.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.7em; margin-bottom:0"><a href="https://ellisjalia.com/2025/01/10/reading-paths/"><b>Reading Paths</b></a></p>
<p style="font-size:0.95em; color: silver">Friday, January 10, 2025</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">For the past few months, I’ve been reading three books: Musashi by Eiji Yoshikawa; Monet: The Restless Vision by Jackie Wullschläger; and Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Little did I know the first two are basically whole lives. Monet is what I’ve been reading a lot of lately. It’s been such an immersive experience, from reading about him begging his friends to send him wine, to the tragic death of his wife, and the circumstances around the painting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magpie_(Monet)" style="color:tomato">“The Magpie”</a>.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/reading-paths-1.png" style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top: 1em;"></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Likewise with Musashi. Following him as he grows up, and as he learns that mastery of the sword comes through mastery of unrelated disciplines like calligraphy, pottery and painting, has opened up so many avenues. The Kant book is a different beast altogether, however, but I’m committed now. Even if it takes me a year, I will finish it.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">A question I’ve been posing myself recently is, <b>what reading paths should I take in the future?</b></p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/reading-paths-2.png" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;"></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">This quote by Jean Piaget got me thinking about reading as a path that you can take to increase your powers to order the world:

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">"The goal of education is not to increase the amount of knowledge but to create the possibilities for a child to invent and discover, to create men who are capable of doing new things."</p>
