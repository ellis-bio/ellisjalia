Dear friends, <br>
<br>I stole the idea for this list from <a href="https://austinkleon.com" style="color:tomato">Austin Kleon</a>, who said that he stole it from another guy. The idea is quite intriguing, since it reminded me of a poem called <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uEUXvwuX_DyqFS0K4MeykW40VGQCGa8Rt1T5RlA-rHY/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:tomato">“London Rain”</a> by Louis MacNeice: “My wishes turn to violent, horses black as coal–; The Randy mares of fancy, the stallions of the soul; Eager to take the fences, That fence about my soul.”

Essentially, I see this list as a sort of peek-over-the-fence; what I could be reading if I didn’t have work to do! Anyway, here’s my take on it:
<br>
<img src="/assets/images/10-books-1.png" style="width:100%">
<br>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">1. <b>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9673436-the-invention-of-hugo-cabret" style="color:tomato"><b>Brian Selznick</b></a>.</p>
<p style="font-size:1.0em">All I know about this book is that it’s about a boy who lives in a train station clock tower, and that it was made into a film. It won the 2008 Caldecott Medal, though, which is awarded to the “artist for the most distinguished American picture book for children”. Looks great!</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">2. <b>Van Gogh Still Lifes</b>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9673436-the-invention-of-hugo-cabret" style="color:tomato"><b>Obtrude Westheider</b></a>.</p>
<p style="font-size:1.0em">“A great fire burns within me, but no one stops to warm themselves at it, and passers-by only see a wisp of smoke”. Man, every time I see a new Van Gogh book, I just want to buy it. In the summer, I hope to go to New York, to finally see his great painting. 

3. First Love by Ivan Turgenev Avrahm Yarmolinsky: “…when the page was warmed by the glow of a casual affair”. Supposedly the writer Henry James, who loved Turgenev, believed that Turgenev is more worth reading than Leo Tolstoy (once I read War and Peace, I guess I’ll make up my own mind). The book is supposedly about unrequited love, which sucks! But since I loved Turgenev’s Fathers and Sons, I’m looking forward to giving this one a go at some point.  

4. Dream Story by Arthur Schnitzler
This story is the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut, a film I love a lot. And, ahem, I definitely don’t want to read it because of some fantasy that I have to one day host my own masquerade ball, where I dress as Red Cloak. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140902030345/http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/2003/Greenwich%20conference.html" style="color:tomato">Or was that the point of the film?</a> &#129300;

5. The Narrow Road to the Deep North and Other Travel Sketches by Matsuo BashoWho doesn’t love a good Basho poem? “an ancient pond / a frog jumps in / the splash of water”. There’s nothing else to say. 
6. Night of the Milky Way Railway by Kenji MiyazawaI’m kinda drawn to this book like a Raven to shiny things (which, for, some reason, reminded me of the Raven paradox). Anyway–this book has such a great cover. I can’t wait to buy a copy and read it!
7. A Beautiful Question: Finding Nature’s Deep Design by Frank WilczekBy accident one day, I discovered this giant of physics! I have his other books, The Lightness of Being and Fundamentals: Ten Keys to Reality, but this one has eluded me (I’m sure I’ll be able to find a good copy of the hardcover edition one day)! The idea of beauty inherent in the physical construction of the universe sounds fascinating, and perhaps 2025 will be the year when I finally get round to this gem. 
8. The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth GrahameI love children’s books, and the fact that I haven’t read as many as I’d like this year is a shame (although I did read Miyazaki’s only published work, Shuna’s Journey, which is fantastic and I highly recommend it). Maybe I’ll get round to this when I also get round to The Borrowers by Mary Norton.
9. Substance, Force, and the Possibility of Knowledge: On Kant’s Philosophy of the Material World by Jeffrey EdwardsMonths after starting it, I’m still slogging through Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason (although I think I’m doing better than one other reader I came across, who took four years to finish it). What’s so surprising about Kant, contrary to popular opinion, is how clear he actually is as a writer; after every sentence, I’m basically stopping to jot down notes. And then I spend a week thinking about it. 
10. Lectures on Imagination by Paul Ricoeur
I don’t really know anything about Ricoeur, besides the fact that he wrote a book about Freud, Nietzsche and Marx. But a book about the mind’s powers sounds right up my alley.

Honourable mentions for books yet to be released: Visual Arts and Human Flourishing by Selma Holo and Aristotle on the Essence of Human Thought by Klaus Corcilius, et al, both to be published in early 2025. I feel like 2024 wasn’t a great year for publishing, but 2025 looks like it might be one of the best yet.

At the end of the month, I’ll also post my top 10 books of 2024. So watch this space!
