<p style="margin-top: 2em;">"One, two, three, — but where, my dear Timaeus, is the fourth...?" - Plato</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve experimented with active imagination, a technique made famous by the psychiatrist Carl Jung. The aim of the method is to draw up images from the unconscious, as a means of providing the self with information about its state and condition, and as a means of arriving to the true nature of the self.</p>

<p>It begins with actively imagining a state of affairs, or closing your eyes and drawing images, and the idea is that naturally a bridge will be built between the “empirical self” - what one actively perceives and thinks - and the total self, which includes the contents of the unconscious.</p>

<p>While I didn't know what to expect, it has been an enlightening experience. A few years ago, I actively sought the dissolution of the ego (and that of the persona), so that I might separate myself from the suggestions of the collective unconscious. Being ill prepared for this task, and resolutely naive in my underestimation of the power that archetypal images exert over the psyche, I plunged into darkness. For many years, I did not know up from down, or left from right.</p>

<p>Even to this day, the unconscious exerts such significant control over my mental life, that I am taken under at a moments notice, into the shadow lands. Not only does this have the unfortunate side effect of completely alienating me from society, my family, and my friends, but I constantly feel the pull of the unconscious, exerting its formidable influence over my behaviours. As a result, there is in me a representation of the archetypal “Wanderer” - a man broken by the winds of time, whose memories have been washed away, and he can no longer return home nor remember what he seeks.</p>

<p>But all is not lost. For you see, in my battle with myself, this inner civil war, I have grown to understand the unconscious, what it might represent, and how to use its strengths. I have begun to engage it in serious diplomacy.</p>

<p>I speak of the unconscious as an “it” - for anyone who has disassociated from the collective psyche are well aware that the unconscious is alive. It is a dynamic entity of an autonomous nature, living behind the veil of experience, that possesses its own desires and wishes. For the world truly exists with two great forces within it - good and evil. This is not to say that the unconscious is inherently evil, because I do not think that is the case, but I believe it possesses the capacity for evil. Like Jung said, “man is the great danger”.</p> 

<p>What I have said so far is neither original nor out of the extraordinary - because this knowledge goes back one hundred years to the great founding psychologists, and to the Ancient Greeks before that. So what, then, is the point that I’m making? It’s simply this: the unconscious can be as powerful in guiding you towards the right path as any information received externally.</p>

<p>But let me urge that you take great caution - the unconscious is truly a heavy burden to carry, and it has broken me more times than I care to admit. It is fortunate that I have discovered ways of stitching the psyche back together again. So take great care should you go diving into that vast lake where monsters, gods, and kings - the archetypes - pull the strings behind Man’s emotions and behaviours. Journey into yourself, if you haven’t already done so. For I assure you my dear friend, reader, the treasure that you seek is within you.</p>
