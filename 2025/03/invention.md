<p>One thing I’m interested in is finding new ways to combine my reading. In my previous post, I talked about reading paths. This is the idea that through reading, one can reason about things not by asking, “what happened?”, but “how could things be put together in new ways?”.</p>

<p>It’s also a Platonic view: that the reading paths are a way of becoming, or making yourself over time, as a conditional on the path you choose to take.</p>

<p>Although this view sounds interesting, at least philosophically, I’m generally more inclined to the view that the paths will reveal aspects of yourself that were hidden from view.</p>

<p>To expand on the idea of readings paths, I have in mind invention. The word ‘invention’ comes from ‘invencioun’, meaning “finding or discovering of something”. It also stems from the Latin ‘inventionem’, which means to “to come upon, find out”; and the Proto-Indo-European roots of ’in’ and ‘*gwa-’, meaning “to come” and “to go”.</p>

<p>What stands out to me is that to invent, you must go to the idea. That is, you must find out. To visualise this, I came up with the following method.</p>

<p>Art informs invention, and invention informs science, in the sense that often we go to the science we require to do what we have in mind; science will inform philosophy, and the chain is refreshed by literature.</p>
