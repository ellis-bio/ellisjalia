<p>One of my favourite books is Einstein’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Relativity-Special-General-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143039822" style="color:tomato">Relativity</a>. I’ve read it a few times over the years, and despite the sound logic, it's always counterintuitive. Then last year, I read Einstein’s paper on General Relativity, <a href="https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol6-trans/158" style="color:tomato">The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity</a>. It was amazing to see how he worked out the relations between dynamic curvature, distance, mass-energy content and the cosmological constant. If you bear in mind these relations, the paper isn’t as intractable as one would think.</p>

<p>Einstein was a philosopher above all else (in my humble opinion), knowing how much he was influenced by Spinoza, Leibniz and Newton. And over the years, despite knowing quite a bit about his background, his work and his life, I’ve wanted to delve deeper into his thought about the unification of nature at the most fundamental level.</p>

<p>Einstein’s thought is pretty interesting to me because, even though he <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Subtle-Lord-Science-Albert-Einstein/dp/0192806726" style="color:tomato">held</a> on to the idea of classical causality until the end, his thinking was heavily influenced by the idealist philosophers (and I’d probably consider myself an idealist, if it came to it). Honestly, I don’t know what I’m hoping the outcome of this reading will lead to. But every time I mix subjects that seem unrelated, it always bears good intellectual fruit.</p>

<p>The nature of thought is also another subject that I’m heavily interested in, and I’m hoping to find some new ground in the area. Having read lots about mental representation, computationalism, and functionalism, I’m still left wanting. So perhaps a return to Aristotle’s thought will lead to something new.</p>

<p>The book “Basic Electricity” is an old one, and I don’t think it’s used in modern courses on Electrical Engineering, but I don’t think the principles have changed much so it might serve as a good starting option. One reason I’ve opted for it is to get into <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction" style="color:tomato">Arduino</a>, and develop from there. Again, I don’t know what the outcome is going to be, but if I don’t try, I’ll never find out.</p>
