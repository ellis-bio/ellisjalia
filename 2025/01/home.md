<p style="font-size:0.95em; color: silver">Sunday, January 19, 2025</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">I’m supposed to be working on an essay about the philosophy of perception, but I’ve been really unwell and research has been difficult. So instead I turned my attention to redesigning my living room and workspace.</p>

<center><img src="/assets/images/home-2.jpeg" style="margin-bottom:1.5em; margin-top: 1.5em;"></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">For Christmas, I got a record player which has been sitting on the floor, and I wanted to try out some placements for it. Space is scarce, and in the doodle above, I’m committing the grave sin of putting the speakers on the same surface as the turntable. But I’m not after the pure audiophile experience so it’ll have to do for now.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">For the longest time, I’ve worked on this nice antique desk, with my MacBook Pro hooked up to a Thunderbolt Display, and an anglepoise lamp.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Sketching has given me insight into what works and what doesn’t; particularly with respect to the idea that each desirable activity ought to have a place of its own.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Then I turned to my workspace area. The antique desk usually serves me well. But as I’ve placed an order for a new computer, I thought this would be a good opportunity for an overhaul.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">The new desk is made from oak, and it’s almost twice as large as my previous one. There would be enough space for a ceramic lamp, and potentially for two anglepoise lamps so the light is evenly distributed throughout.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">I’ve tried to seek inspiration from a variety of sources. Some of the colours have come from the ukiyo-e drawings of Hokusai, Yoshitoshi and Kuniyoshi. Whereas material choice was mainly based on a concoction of old photos that I have from Obama’s terms in the White House, and other random pieces.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Ultimately what I’ve tried to create is a place that comes from deep within me, that combines beauty and care, and where over the next few years I can test what I’m really capable of.</p>
