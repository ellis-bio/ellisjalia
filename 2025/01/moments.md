<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Before atoms were empirically verified, the philosopher Leibniz postulated that the universe is composed of an infinite number of ‘monads’, indivisible entities which only possess qualities. He wrote:
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">“4. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and, in a word, the
elements of things.”</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">“19. If we are to give the name of Soul to everything which has perceptions and desires [appetits] in the general sense which I have explained, then all simple substances or created Monads might be called souls…”</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">In a famous passage, he said that “monads have no windows”. Through the above sketches, I wanted to capture this idea; that the mind only sees what is internal to it––its perceptions and the changes that occur within them.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">But there is also another idea that I wanted to capture.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">In The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 1, Schopenhauer has a quote about ‘Now’ (the quote is in a footnote, on page 280):
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">“The scholastics taught that eternity is not a succession without beginning and end, but a permanent Now; in other words, that we possess the same Now which existed for Adam; that is to say, there is no difference between the Now and the Then.”</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">I wanted to capture these moments from some of my days, in addition to conveying those two ideas above, to remind me of the wonderful things that I am lucky to use and be able to do.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">These are things which I did not create nor understand (the computer, the sky and the trees), and those things which I need to stay alive.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">As time seems to run faster and faster, I recognise that life is but a collection of these moments.
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Just maybe, that’s what our brains are for: to lift a snapshot of reality, and to hold it in place for long enough so that we can point to it and say “Now”. </p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">And I love also drawing (when it goes right). It makes me feel really involved in my greatest passion, the joy of seeing.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">“I think I need to keep being creative, not to prove anything but because it makes me happy just to do it... I think trying to be creative, keeping busy, has a lot to do with keeping you alive.” - Willie Nelson</p>
