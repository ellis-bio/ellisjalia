<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Before atoms were empirically verified, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Leibnizs-Monadology-New-Translation-Guide/dp/074869322X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=355OSBV9QMY12&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.P74slB61DL_NxxCJjOYyV1Z8---gFQEmsfcdtpa92EkWkVtN0XwDBVFyq0ypJ9Ro0vnYCUiMB-bWRLeb64hNsI60kTVlNGye_-ZDiASLCmoyoI_PacK5nUJIbWsCEcU4Zy0SeO2iA_DDeb_hj0f4CV-oPh__IaTPF-EWIC183gWnoiJhXVvysE56aszObNFPnaVz0FMugP2ICCTYo75stxMvmdzF_AKA15cGTykEPy4.pQRWl4J13A03ULgjMSCqNoNPx1o_5Se-n7u9HrXkmEI&dib_tag=se&keywords=leibniz+monadology&qid=1738189077&sprefix=leibniz+monadology%2Caps%2C108&sr=8-1" style="color:tomato">Leibniz</a> postulated that the universe is composed of an infinite number of ‘monads’, indivisible entities which only possess qualities. He wrote:
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">“4. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and, in a word, the
elements of things.”</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">“19. If we are to give the name of Soul to everything which has perceptions and desires [appetits] in the general sense which I have explained, then all simple substances or created Monads might be called souls…”</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">In a famous passage, he said that “monads have no windows”. Through the above sketches, I wanted to capture this idea; that the mind only sees what is internal to it––its perceptions and the changes that occur within them.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">But there is also another idea that I wanted to capture.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">In <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/World-Will-Representation-Vol-v/dp/0486217612" style="color:tomato">The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 1</a>, Schopenhauer has a quote about ‘Now’ (the quote is in a footnote, on page 280):
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">“The scholastics taught that eternity is not a succession without beginning and end, but a permanent Now; in other words, that we possess the same Now which existed for Adam; that is to say, there is no difference between the Now and the Then.”</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">There is also a reminiscence of an <a href="https://putsomethingback.stevejobsarchive.com/" style="color:tomato">e-mail</a> that Steve Jobs sent to himself, reminding him of his love, admiration and his total dependence on humanity for his survival and well-being. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">I wanted to capture these moments from my day, in addition to conveying those two ideas above, to remind me of the wonderful things that I am lucky to use and be able to do. </p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">These are things which I did not create nor understand (the computer, the sky and the trees), and those things which I need to stay alive.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">The wonder that is my iPhone.<br>
The strangeness and wonder of trees and the sky.<br>
My computer.<br>
Writing and sketching.<br>
Going for bike rides.<br>
Reading a book.<br>
Eating good food.<br>
Exercising.<br>
Sleeping.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">As time seems to run faster and faster, I recognise that life is but a collection of these moments.
</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Just maybe, that’s what our brains are for: to lift a snapshot of reality, and to hold it in place for long enough so that we can point to it and say “Now”. </p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">And I also love drawing (when it goes right). It makes me feel really involved in my greatest passion, the joy of seeing.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">“I think I need to keep being creative, not to prove anything but because it makes me happy just to do it... I think trying to be creative, keeping busy, has a lot to do with keeping you alive.” - Willie Nelson</p>
