<p style="font-size:1.7em; margin-bottom:0"><strong>Design Inspiration</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:0.95em; color: silver">Friday, January 3, 2025</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">Just before Christmas, I was joking with a friend and we talked about the "cosmic perspective", namely about the futility of war and human suffering as seen from the universe&mdash;if it had a face. Our exchange went something like this:</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">Me: “Can you imagine what people must seem like if there were beings as big as black holes? We don't even know where the planet is traveling to, like it's destination in space.”</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em; margin: 1.5em;">Him: “Yeah I know right, and people spend time building things to shoot at one-another? Look at what I made: it goes 'ka-boom', wow.”</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">My friend's point, “Look at what I made”, struck a chord because it got me thinking about design from that vantage point: wouldn't it be nice if those same imaginary large-scale beings said, “Damn, they're so puny, but they make good stuff”, more often? </p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">When I designed the navigation menu for this blog, I had in mind great interactive elements; when you click on an icon, and it lights up, a world of possibility opens up (I'm sorry that there's not much content on here at the moment).</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">I used inspiration from a variety of places; I killed some time looking at 90s websites on <a href="http://web.archive.org/" style="color:tomato">Wayback Machine</a> and old Apple software, particularly HyperCard, a bitmap rolodex software that was a precursor to the web browser.</p>

<center><p style="font-size:0.9em; color: grey; margin-bottom:1em;">Apple HyperCard</p></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">The original Microsoft Windows 1.0 also served as inspiration, primarily its colour scheme (PCjs have an <a href="https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/sys/windows/1.00/" style="color: tomato">emulator</a> that you can try, if you're interested).</p>

<center><p style="font-size:0.9em; color: grey; margin-bottom:1em;">Microsoft Windows 1.01</p></center>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">My thinking was to combine <b>architecture</b> (that there should balance, proportion and rhythm), <b>cartography</b> (legibility, contrast and organisation), <b>interaction design</b> (constraints, feedback and recognition rather than recall) and <b>psychology</b> (pleasure, happiness and guidance). 

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">And I love this site; the way it feels as I navigate across it, the colour scheme, and the fact that I'm not constrained by software besides the language of the internet itself. I have big plans for it.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.10em;">I also know that it's not much. But it is mine, and I am simultaneously its architect and caretaker.</p>
